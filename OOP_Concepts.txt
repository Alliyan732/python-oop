Why OOP:
1) Every real world entity is an object, so we can solve real world problems by taking real world entities as objects in OOP.
2) Security

Objects: 
    Objects have 'data' and 'methods'

Class:
    we group similar kind of objects in a Class, It acts as a blueprint or a template for the object.
    we create blueprint once and then can create multiple objects according that class
