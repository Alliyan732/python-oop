""" 
Encapsulation:
    Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and involves bundling
    the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. The idea is to hide
    the internal state of an object and restrict access to its implementation details. This helps in organizing and 
    managing code, as well as providing a level of security by controlling access to the internal data.

    In Python, encapsulation is achieved by using private and protected access modifiers.

    Access Modifiers:

    1. Public (default):
        Members declared as public are accessible from outside the class.
        In Python, all members of a class are public by default.

    2. Protected (_ prefix):
        Members declared as protected are accessible within the class and its subclasses.
        Conventionally, a single leading underscore is added to the name to indicate that 
        it should be treated as protected.

    3. Private (__ prefix):
        Members declared as private are accessible only within the class itself.
        A double leading underscore is added to the name to make it private.

# simple example of encapsualtion

class Person:
    
    _name = "Alliyan" # protected
    __age = 20        # private

    def show(self):
        print(f"Name is {self._name} and age is {self.__age}")


person = Person()
print(person._name) # it will print Alliyan beacause _name is a protected variable and can be called using class object.
# print(person.__age) # it will give error beacause __age is a private variable.

person.show()   # it will print both name and age beacause show is the public function that can access both variables
                # because it is in the same class.
